| Datagristle is a toolbox of tough and flexible data connectors and
  analyzers.
| It’s kind of an interactive mix between ETL and data analysis
  optimized for rapid analysis and manipulation of a wide variety of
  data.

It’s neither an enterprise ETL tool, nor an enterprise analysis,
reporting, or data mining tool. It’s intended to be an easily-adopted
tool for technical analysts that combines the most useful subset of data
transformation and analysis capabilities necessary to do 80% of the
work. Its open source python codebase allows it to be easily extended to
with custom code to handle that always challenging last 20%.

Current Status: Strong support for easy analysis, simple transformations
of csv files, ability to create data dictionaries, change detection, and
emerging data quality capabilities.

Next Steps:
===========

-  attractive PDF output of gristle_determinator.py
-  metadata database population

Its objectives include:
=======================

-  multi-platform (unix, linux, mac os, windows with effort)
-  multi-language (primarily python)
-  free - no cripple-licensing
-  primary audience is programming data analysts - not non-technical
   analysts
-  primary environment is command-line rather than windows, graphical
   desktop or eclipse
-  extensible
-  allow a bi-directional iteration between ETL & data analysis
-  can quickly perform initial data analysis prior to longer-duration,
   deeper analysis with heavier-weight tools.

Installation
============

-  Using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__:

   ::

      $ pip install datagristle

Dependencies
============

-  Python 3.8
-  or Python 3.7

Utilities Provided in This Release:
===================================

-  gristle_slicer

   -  Used to extract a subset of columns and rows out of an input file.

-  gristle_freaker

   -  Produces a frequency distribution of multiple columns from input
      file.

-  gristle_determinator

   -  Identifies file formats, generates metadata, prints file analysis
      report
   -  This is the most mature - and also used by the other utilities so
      that you generally do not need to enter file structure info.

-  gristle_differ

   -  Allows two identically-structured files to be compared by key
      columns and split into same, inserts, deletes, chgold and chgnew
      files.
   -  The user can configure which columns are included in the
      comparison.
   -  Post delta transformations can include assign sequence numbers,
      copying field values, etc.

-  gristle_validator

   -  Validates csv files by confirming that all records have the right
      number of fields, and by apply a json schema full of requirements
      to each record.

-  gristle_dir_merger

   -  Used to consolidate large directories with options to control
      matching criteria as well as matching actions.

-  gristle_processor

   -  Used to apply actions, like delete, compress, etc, to files based
      on very flexible criteria.

-  gristle_viewer

   -  Shows one record from a file at a time - formatted based on
      metadata.

gristle_validator
=================

::

   Splits a csv file into two separate files based on how records pass or fail
   validation checks:
      - Field count - checks the number of fields in each record against the
        number required.  The correct number of fields can be provided in an
        argument or will default to using the number from the first record.
      - Schema - uses csv file requirements defined in a json-schema file for
        quality checking.  These requirements include the number of fields, 
        and for each field - the type, min & max length, min & max value,
        whether or not it can be blank, existance within a list of valid
        values, and finally compliance with a regex pattern.

   The output can just be the return code (0 for success, 1+ for errors), can
   be some high level statistics, or can be the csv input records split between
   good and erroneous files.  Output can also be limited to a random subset.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv -f 3
            Prints all valid input rows to stdout, prints all records with 
            other than 3 fields to stderr along with an extra final field that
            describes the error.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv 
            Prints all valid input rows to stdout, prints all records with 
            other than the same number of fields found on the first record to
            stderr along with an extra final field that describes the error.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv  -d '|' --hasheader
            Same comparison as above, but in this case the file was too small
            or complex for the pgm to automatically determine csv dialect, so
            we had to explicitly give that info to program.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv --outgood sample_good.csv --outerr sample_err.csv
            Same comparison as above, but explicitly splits good and bad data
            into separate files.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv --randomout 1
            Same comparison as above, but only writes a random 1% of data out.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv --silent
            Same comparison as above, but writes nothing out.  Exit code can be
            used to determine if any bad records were found.
      $ gristle_validator  sample.csv --validschema sample_schema.csv 
            The above command checks both field count as well as validations
            described in the sample_schema.csv file.  Here's an example of what 
            that file might look like:
               items:
                   - title:            rowid
                     blank:            False
                     required:         True
                     dg_type:          integer
                     dg_minimum:       1
                     dg_maximum:       60
                   - title:            start_date
                     blank:            False
                     minLength:        8
                     maxLength:        10
                     pattern:          '[0-9]*/[0-9]*/[1-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
                   - title:            location
                     blank:            False
                     minLength:        2
                     maxLength:        2
                     enum:             ['ny','tx','ca','fl','wa','ga','al','mo']

gristle_slicer
==============

::

   Extracts subsets of input files based on user-specified columns and rows.
   The input csv file can be piped into the program through stdin or identified
   via a command line option.  The output will default to stdout, or redirected
   to a filename via a command line option.

   The columns and rows are specified using python list slicing syntax -
   so individual columns or rows can be listed as can ranges.   Inclusion
   or exclusion logic can be used - and even combined.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_slicer sample.csv
                   Prints all rows and columns
      $ gristle_slicer sample.csv -c":5, 10:15" -C 13
                   Prints columns 0-4 and 10,11,12,14 for all records
      $ gristle_slicer sample.csv -C:-1
                   Prints all columns except for the last for all records
      $ gristle_slicer sample.csv -c:5 -r-100
                   Prints columns 0-4 for the last 100 records
      $ gristle_slicer sample.csv -c:5 -r-100 -d'|' --quoting=quote_all
                   Prints columns 0-4 for the last 100 records, csv
                   dialect info (delimiter, quoting) provided manually)
      $ cat sample.csv | gristle_slicer -c:5 -r-100 -d'|' --quoting=quote_all
                   Prints columns 0-4 for the last 100 records, csv
                   dialect info (delimiter, quoting) provided manually)
    

gristle_freaker
===============

::

   Creates a frequency distribution of values from columns of the input file
   and prints it out in columns - the first being the unique key and the last 
   being the count of occurances.


   Examples:
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  -c 0
                   Creates two columns from the input - the first with
                   unique keys from column 0, the second with a count of
                   how many times each exists.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  -c 0 --sortcol 1 --sortorder forward --writelimit 25
                   In addition to what was described in the first example, 
                   this example adds sorting of the output by count ascending 
                   and just prints the first 25 entries.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  -c 0 --sampling_rate 3 --sampling_method interval
                   In addition to what was described in the first example,
                   this example adds a sampling in which it only references
                   every third record.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  -c 0,1
                   Creates three columns from the input - the first two
                   with unique key combinations from columns 0 & 1, the 
                   third with the number of times each combination exists.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  -c -1
                   Creates two columns from the input - the first with unique
                   keys from the last column of the file (negative numbers 
                   wrap), then a second with the number of times each exists.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  --columntype all
                   Creates two columns from the input - all columns combined
                   into a key, then a second with the number of times each
                   combination exists.
      $ gristle_freaker sample.csv -d '|'  --columntype each
                   Unlike the other examples, this one performs a separate
                   analysis for every single column of the file.  Each analysis
                   produces three columns from the input - the first is a 
                   column number, second is a unique value from the column, 
                   and the third is the number of times that value appeared.  
                   This output is repeated for each column.

gristle_viewer
==============

::

   Displays a single record of a file, one field per line, with field names 
   displayed as labels to the left of the field values.  Also allows simple 
   navigation between records.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_viewer sample.csv -r 3 
                   Presents the third record in the file with one field per line
                   and field names from the header record as labels in the left
                   column.
      $ gristle_viewer sample.csv -r 3  -d '|' -q quote_none
                   In addition to what was described in the first example this
                   adds explicit csv dialect overrides.
                          

gristle_determinator
====================

::

   Analyzes the structures and contents of csv files in the end producing a 
   report of its findings.  It is intended to speed analysis of csv files by
   automating the most common and frequently-performed analysis tasks.  It's
   useful in both understanding the format and data and quickly spotting issues.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_determinator japan_station_radiation.csv
                   This command will analyze a file with radiation measurements
                   from various Japanese radiation stations.

       File Structure:
       format type:       csv
       field cnt:         4
       record cnt:        100
       has header:        True

gristle_differ
==============

::

   gristle_differ compares two files, typically an old and a new file, based 
   on explicit keys in a way that is far more accurate than diff.  It can also
   compare just subsets of columns, and perform post-delta transforms to 
   populate fields with static values, values from other fields, variables
   from the command line, or incrementing sequence numbers.

   More info on the wiki here:  https://github.com/kenfar/DataGristle/wiki/gristle_differ

   Examples:

      $ gristle_differ file0.dat file1.dat --key-cols 0 2 --ignore_cols  19 22 33 

           - Sorts both files on columns 0 & 2
           - Dedupes both files on column 0
           - Compares all fields except fields 19,22, and 23
           - Automatically determines the csv dialect
           - Produces the following files:
              - file1.dat.insert
              - file1.dat.delete
              - file1.dat.same
              - file1.dat.chgnew
              - file1.dat.chgold

      $ gristle_differ file0.dat file1.dat --key-cols 0 --compare-cols 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  -d '|'

           - Sorts both files on columns 0 
           - Dedupes both files on column 0
           - Compares fields 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
           - Uses '|' as the field delimiter
           - Produces the same output file names as example 1.


      $ gristle_differ file0.dat file1.dat --config-fn ./foo.yml  \
                  --variables batchid:919 --variables pkid:82304

           - Produces the same output file names as example 1.
           - But in this case it gets the majority of its configuration items from
             the config file ('foo.yml').  This could include key columns, comparison
             columns, ignore columns, post-delta transformations, and other information.
       - The two variables options are used to pass in user-defined variables that
             can be referenced by the post-delta transformations.  The batchid will get
             copied into a batch_id column for every file, and the pkid is a sequence
             that will get incremented and used for new rows in the insert, delete and
             chgnew files.

gristle_metadata
================

::

   Gristle_metadata provides a command-line interface to the metadata database.
   It's mostly useful for scripts, but also useful for occasional direct
   command-line access to the metadata.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_metadata --table schema --action list
                   Prints a list of all rows for the schema table.
      $ gristle_metadata --table element --action put --prompt
                   Allows the user to input a row into the element table and 
                   prompts the user for all fields necessary.
                          

gristle_md_reporter
===================

::

   Gristle_md_reporter allows the user to create data dictionary reports that
   combine information about the collection and fields along with field value
   descriptions and frequencies.

   Examples:
      $ gristle_md_reporter --report datadictionary --collection_id 2
                   Prints a data dictionary report of collection_id 2.
      $ gristle_md_reporter --report datadictionary --collection_name presidents
                   Prints a data dictionary report of the president collection.
      $ gristle_md_reporter --report datadictionary --collection_id 2 --field_id 3
                   Prints a data dictionary report of the president collection,
                   only shows field-level information for field_id 3.

gristle_dir_merger
==================

::

   Gristle_dir_merger consolidates directory structures of files.  Is both fast
   and flexible with a variety of options for choosing which file to use based
   on full (name and md5) and partial matches (name only) .

   Examples
      $ gristle_dir_merger /tmp/foo /data/foo
            - Compares source of /tmp/foo to dest of /data/foo.
            - Files will be consolidated into /data/foo, and deleted from /tmp/foo.
            - Comparison will be: match-on-name-and-md5 (default)
            - Full matches will use: keep_dest (default)
            - Partial matches will use: keep_newest (default)
            - Bottom line: this is what you normally want.
      $ gristle_dir_merger /tmp/foo /data/foo --dry-run
            - Same as the first example - except it only prints what it would do
              without actually doing it.
            - Bottom line: this is a good step to take prior to running it for real.
      $ gristle_dir_merger /tmp/foo /data/foo -r
            - Same as the first example - except it runs recursively through
              the directories.
      $ gristle_dir_merger /tmp/foo /data/foo --on-partial-match keep-biggest
            - Comparison will be: match-on-name-and-md5 (default)
            - Full matches will use: keep_dest (default)
            - Partial matches will use: keep_biggest (override)
            - Bottom line: this is a good combo if you know that some files
              have been modified on both source & dest, and newest isn't the best.
      $ gristle_dir_merger /tmp/foo /data/foo --match-on-name-only --on-full-match keep-source
            - Comparison will be: match-on-name-only (override)
            - Full matches will use: keep_source (override)
            - Bottom line: this is a good way to go if you have
              files that have changed in both directories, but always want to
              use the source files.
