V0.2.3 - 2022-11
================

-  Improvement: gristle_slicer - add support for writing data out in the
   config order rather than the data order, as well as negative,
   positive and random stepping.
-  BREAKING CHANGE: refactored gristle_validator:

   -  added examples
   -  improved error reporting
   -  replaced obsolete customized jsonschema version with support for
      the current version (Draft 7)

-  BREAKING CHANGE: Removed gristle_processor.
-  BREAKING CHANGE: envvar and config file boolean args with values
   other than True, true, t, or 1 will be rejected. This is because they
   can be very ambiguous and confusing, in particular with with a pair
   of args like has-header and has-no-header.
-  Improvement: crash reporting is now more consistent, complete and
   informative
-  Improvement: is now enforcing the minimum version of 3.8. It was
   previously almost completely working on 3.7 but would occasionally
   crash on a 3.8 feature.
-  Improvement: replaced pyyaml with ruamel.yaml - to better support
   config generation.
-  Bug Fix: fixed pathing on two bash aliases: gristle_determinator &
   gristle_file_converter
-  Bug Fix: fixed bug in handling of obsolete options

V0.2.2 - 2021-07
================

-  Improvement: the field-names from headers can now be used instead of
   column offsets for gristle_sorter, gristle_freaker, gristle_profiler,
   and gristle_slicer.
-  Improvement: The use of the header now follows four simple rules:

   -  It can be referred to as row 0 when it makes sense - like with
      gristle_slicer & gristle_viewer.
   -  It will be passed through when it makes sense - like with
      gristle_sorter.
   -  It will be used to translate field names to offsets for
      configuration.
   -  But will otherwise be ignored.

-  Bug Fix: gristle_freaker was failing with 0-length files when using
   col-type=each
-  Bug Fix: gristle_sorter was failing with some multi-directional sorts

V0.2.1 - 2021-04
================

-  Improvement: added gristle_sorter as a script to install in the
   system so that it is available to users.

V0.2.0 - 2021-04
================

-  Improvement: Now supports python versions 3.8 and 3.9.
-  Improvement: All csv programs now support envvars and config files
   for input and can generate config files.
-  Improvement: Programs always autodetect file csv dialect before
   applying user overrides - except for piped-in data.
-  BREAKING CHANGE: dropped support for python version 3.7
-  BREAKING CHANGES to all csv programs:

   -  Various changes to names of options for consistency, with older
      versions caught with an error msg to provides new name.
   -  Various changes to csv dialect handling for consistency and
      correct handling of escapechar, doublequoting, skipinitialspace.

v0.1.7 - 2020-07
================

-  Improvement: now supports python versions 3.7 and 3.8
-  BREAKING CHANGE: dropped support for python version 3.6
-  Bumped versions on dependent modules to eliminate vulnerabilities
-  gristle_differ

   -  BREAKING CHANGE: col_names renamed to col-names for consistency
   -  Fixes –already-unix option bug with file parsing
   -  Fixes –stats bug with empty files
   -  Improvement: added ability to use column names from file headers
   -  Improvement: if a key-col is in the ignore-cols - it will simply
      be ignored, and the program will continue processing.
   -  Improvement: if a key-col is in the compare-cols - it will simply
      be ignored, and the program will continue processing.
   -  Improvement: if neither compare or ignore cols are provided it
      will use all cols as compare-cols and continue processing.
   -  Improvement: CLI help is updated to provide more details and
      accurate examples of these options.

v0.1.6 - 2019-02
================

-  upgraded to support python3.7

v0.1.5 - 2018-05
================

-  fixed setup.py bug in which pip10 no longer includes req module

v0.1.4 - 2017-12
================

-  fixed gristle_validator bug in which checks on dg_maximum were not
   being run

v0.1.3 - 2017-08
================

-  additional improvements to code quality, but with some breaking
   changes
-  changed argument handling for multiple utilities to simplify code and
   get more consistency.

   -  affects: gristle_freaker, gristle_slicer, and gristle_viewer
   -  This means words are separated by hyphens, not underscores.
      –sortorder is –sort-order.

-  changed file handling for multiple utilities to simplify code and get
   more consistency.

   -  affects: gristle_freaker, gristle_slicer, gristle_validator, and
      gristle_viewer
   -  This means that behavior in handling multiple files, piped input,
      and other edge cases is more consistent between utilities.

v0.1.2 - 2017-06
================

-  long-overdue code quality updates

v0.1.1 - 2017-05
================

-  upgraded to use python3.6
-  changed versioning format, which has broken pypy for history

v0.59 - 2016-11
===============

-  gristle_differ

   -  totally rewritten. Can now handle very large files, perform
      post-transform transformations, handle more complex comparisons,
      and use column names rather than just positions.

-  gristle_determinator

   -  added read-limit argument. This allows the tool to be easily run
      against a subset of a very large input file.

-  gristle_scalar

   -  removed from toolkit. There are better tools in other solutions
      can be used instead. This tool may come back again later, but only
      if enormously rewritten.

-  gristle_filter

   -  removed from toolkit. There are better tools in other solutions
      can be used instead. This tool may come back again later, but only
      if enormously rewritten.

-  minor:

   -  gristle_md_reporter - slight formatting change: text descriptions
      of fields are now included, and column widths were tweaked.
   -  all utilities - a substantial performance improvement for large
      files when quoting information is not provided.

v0.58 - 2014-08
===============

-  gristle_dir_merger

   -  initial addition to toolkit. Merges directories of files using a
      variety of matching criteria and matching actions.

v0.57 - 2014-07
===============

-  gristle_processor

   -  initial addition to toolkit. Provides ability to scan through
      directory structure recursively, and delete files that match
      config criteria.

v0.56 - 2014-03
===============

-  gristle_determinator

   -  added hasnoheader arg
   -  fixed problem printing top_values on empty file with header

-  gristle_validator

   -  added hasnoheader arg

-  gristle_freaker

   -  added hasnoheader arg

v0.55 - 2014-02
===============

-  gristle_determinator - fixed a few problems:

   -  the ‘Top Values not shown - all unique’ message being truncated
   -  floats not handled correctly for stddev & variance
   -  quoted ints & floats not handled

v0.54 - 2014-02
===============

-  gristle_validator - major updates to allow validation of csv files
   based on the json schema standard, with help from the Validictory
   module.

v0.53 - 2014-01
===============

-  gristle_freaker - major updates to enable distributes on all columns
   to be automatically gathered through either (all or each) args. ‘All’
   combines all columns into a single tuple prior to producing
   distribution. ‘Each’ creates a separate distribution for every column
   within the csv file.
-  travisci - added support and started using this testing service.
