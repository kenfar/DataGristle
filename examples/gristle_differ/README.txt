    Example-21: Simple diff for an extract process with no assignments.
    Example-22: Complex post-transform diff of incoming new file vs an extract from the warehouse
                that combines all assignments for a typical data warehouse: delete flag, batch_id,
                primary-key generation, and timestamps.
