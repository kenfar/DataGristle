# This example shows a simple diff just used to compare two csv files. 
#
# They may be an old file and a newer file, or they may two different by identically structured 
# files. 
#
# It won't use the features more oriented towards data warehousing like Varibles & Assignments,
# but will use features like getting column names from the file headers, and bypassing sorting
# and deduping since these are assumed already done in this particular case.
