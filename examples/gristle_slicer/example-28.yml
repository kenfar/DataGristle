# Simple slicer that demonstrates the following features:
#     * includes reverse-order stepping over records and columns

# The column spec only features inclusions - and anything outside of these 
# inclusions is an implied exclusion.  A few more notes on negative slicing:
#     * The start & stop values are also reversed: it starts at the bottom and works
#       to the top & left.
#     * The column stop of -8 is past the first column, so it just stops at the first column.
columns: '-1:-8:-1'     # includes every column starting with the last, and moving left
records: '9:1:-2'       # includes every other record starting with the bottom of the file and working up
