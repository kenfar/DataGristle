# The column spec only features inclusions - and anything outside of these 
# inclusions is an implied exclusion.  A few more notes on random steps:
#     * The number provided must be a decimal or float
#     * It is the probability that any given row will qualify and be included
records: '1::0.25'       # includes about 25% of the records between the 2nd (row=1) and the end of the file
